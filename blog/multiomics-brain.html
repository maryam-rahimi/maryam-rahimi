    <h1>Understanding the Brain Through Single-Cell and Multi-Omics AI</h1>
    <p class="date">Published: December 2025 | Author: Maryam Rahimi Movassagh</p>

    <p>
      The brain cannot be understood at a single scale.
      Neural activity, cognition, and disease emerge from
      interactions between genes, cells, circuits, and environments.
      Yet much of neuroscience has historically examined these layers in isolation.
      Single-cell and multi-omics technologies are changing this landscape,
      generating unprecedented biological detail.
      The remaining challenge lies in interpretation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence offers a way forward—but only if models
      are designed to respect biological structure and remain interpretable.
      My research explores how
      <strong>interpretable AI systems</strong>
      can integrate
      <strong>single-cell data, multi-omics profiles, and neuroimaging</strong>
      to uncover early biomarkers and mechanistic insights
      into neurological disorders.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Understanding brain disorders requires models that explain
      how microscopic molecular changes give rise to macroscopic dysfunction.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Single-Cell Resolution Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Brain tissue is highly heterogeneous.
      Even neighboring cells can differ dramatically
      in gene expression, metabolic state, and functional role.
      Traditional bulk analyses average these signals,
      often obscuring early pathological changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Single-cell technologies reveal this hidden diversity.
      They allow us to observe how specific cell populations respond to stress,
      disease progression, or genetic perturbations.
      These early cellular deviations may serve as
      critical biomarkers long before clinical symptoms appear.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-Omics: Capturing the Full Biological Context</h2>
    <p>
      Gene expression alone does not tell the whole story.
      Epigenetic regulation, protein abundance, and metabolic activity
      all influence how cells function within neural circuits.
      Multi-omics profiling captures these complementary layers,
      providing a more complete picture of brain biology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Integrating these data modalities is challenging.
      They differ in scale, noise characteristics, and biological meaning.
      Interpretable AI models can act as unifying frameworks,
      learning shared structure while preserving modality-specific information.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Multi-omics integration transforms isolated measurements
      into coherent biological narratives.
    </div>

    <h2>Linking Molecules to Brain Function</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroimaging and electrophysiology reveal how the brain functions at scale,
      but often lack molecular specificity.
      By linking imaging features to single-cell and multi-omics data,
      researchers can associate functional brain patterns
      with underlying biological mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      This integration enables a shift from descriptive biomarkers
      toward mechanistic understanding.
      Instead of asking where abnormalities occur,
      we begin to ask which molecular pathways drive them.
    </p>

    <h2>The Importance of Interpretability</h2>
    <p>
      In biomedical research, black-box predictions are rarely sufficient.
      Clinicians and neuroscientists require explanations
      that align with biological knowledge.
      Interpretability ensures that AI models can be trusted,
      validated, and translated into real-world impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      By embedding biological constraints and structured representations,
      interpretable AI can highlight meaningful relationships
      between genes, cell types, and brain networks.
      These insights form the foundation for hypothesis generation
      and experimental validation.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Interpretable AI turns complex data into actionable biological insight.
    </div>

    <h2>Toward Early Biomarkers and Precision Neuroscience</h2>
    <p>
      Neurological disorders often develop silently over years.
      Detecting early molecular changes is critical
      for intervention and disease management.
      Single-cell and multi-omics AI models provide
      a pathway toward identifying these early warning signals.
    </p>

    <p>
      By integrating biological data across scales,
      this approach supports a future of
      <strong>precision neuroscience</strong>—
      where diagnosis and treatment are informed
      by an individual’s unique molecular and neural profile.
