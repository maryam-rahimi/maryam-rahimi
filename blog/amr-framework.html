    <h1>Understanding the Brain Through Single-Cell and Multi-Omics AI</h1>
    <p class="date">Published: December 2025 | Author: Maryam Rahimi Movassagh</p>

    <p>
      Neuroscience is undergoing a data revolution. For the first time in history,
      we can measure the brain not only at the systems level—through MRI and EEG—
      but also at the molecular level, through <strong>single-cell sequencing</strong>,
      <strong>multi-omics profiling</strong>, and <strong>spatial transcriptomics</strong>.
      Yet with this abundance of data comes a challenge: 
      how do we connect what happens inside individual cells to large-scale brain
      function and neurological disorders?
    </p>

    <p>
      My Ph.D. research focuses on building <strong>interpretable AI frameworks</strong>
      that bridge molecular-level signals with systems-level behavior. By integrating 
      <strong>single-cell data, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging</strong> into unified 
      computational models, I aim to uncover early biomarkers and mechanistic patterns
      underlying conditions such as ALS, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Modern neuroscience requires models that do more than predict.  
      They must <strong>explain</strong>—revealing how cellular and molecular changes
      cascade into cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Single-Cell and Multi-Omics Matter</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional genomic studies treat tissues as homogeneous, averaging signals across 
      thousands of cells. Single-cell technologies flip this assumption by allowing us to 
      see what each cell is doing individually—its gene expression, its state, and its 
      developmental trajectory.
    </p>

    <p>
      When combined with <strong>proteomics, epigenomics, metabolomics</strong>, and
      <strong>brain imaging</strong>, these datasets give us a panoramic view of the
      nervous system. But such high-dimensional data require AI systems that can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Model interactions across biological scales</li>
      <li>Detect subtle molecular signatures of disease</li>
      <li>Infer causal relationships rather than correlations</li>
      <li>Remain interpretable for clinicians and neuroscientists</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="../dist/assets/img/multiomics_brain.drawio.png" alt="Brain Multi-Omics Model" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure: Multi-omics and imaging provide complementary layers of brain information,
        from genes to circuits to cognition.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Building Interpretable AI for Neuroscience</h2>
    <p>
      In my work, I design AI systems that merge
      <strong>graph neural networks</strong>,
      <strong>foundation models</strong>,
      and <strong>probabilistic reasoning</strong>
      to represent the brain as both a molecular and functional network.
    </p>

    <p>
      These models learn from:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Single-cell transcriptomes</li>
      <li>Spatial gene-expression gradients</li>
      <li>EEG and fMRI dynamics</li>
      <li>Clinical progression patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to create systems that can answer questions such as:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <em>“Which gene-expression patterns predict the transition from healthy neural 
      activity to early disease states?”</em>
    </div>

    <p>
      These insights could support earlier diagnosis, help evaluate treatment effectiveness,
      and guide biomedical discovery toward more personalized interventions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Research Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Neurological disorders remain some of the least understood and most challenging diseases 
      in medicine. By connecting molecular omics with systems-level brain function through 
      interpretable AI, we move closer to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Early detection of neurodegenerative diseases</li>
      <li>Targeted therapeutic strategies</li>
      <li>Better understanding of cognitive decline</li>
      <li>Precision medicine tailored to individuals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As neuroscience becomes increasingly multi-modal, the need for transparent, trustworthy, 
      and biologically grounded AI will only grow. My research aims to contribute to this shift— 
      building computational tools that help decode the brain not as a single system, but as 
      an interconnected biological universe.
