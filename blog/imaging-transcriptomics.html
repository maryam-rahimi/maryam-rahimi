    <h1>Imaging Transcriptomics: Connecting Genes to Brain Function</h1>
    <p class="date">Published: December 2025 | Author: Maryam Rahimi Movassagh</p>

    <p>
      The human brain is one of the most complex biological systems we know.
      For decades, neuroscience has studied it from two largely separate perspectives:
      brain structure and function, measured through imaging techniques such as MRI and EEG,
      and molecular biology, studied through gene expression and transcriptomics.
      <strong>Imaging transcriptomics</strong> aims to bring these worlds together.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its core, imaging transcriptomics asks a powerful question:
      <em>How do patterns of gene expression shape large-scale brain organization,
      activity, and vulnerability to disease?</em>
      By linking molecular data with brain imaging, we begin to understand
      not only where changes occur in the brain, but <strong>why</strong> they occur.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Imaging transcriptomics bridges microscopic biology and macroscopic brain systems,
      connecting genes to circuits, cognition, and neurological disorders.
    </div>

    <h2>What Is Imaging Transcriptomics?</h2>
    <p>
      Imaging transcriptomics is a multi-modal approach that integrates
      <strong>spatial gene-expression data</strong> with
      <strong>neuroimaging features</strong>.
      Gene-expression maps—often derived from postmortem brain atlases or
      spatial transcriptomics—are aligned with imaging-derived measures such as
      cortical thickness, functional connectivity, or electrophysiological activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is a framework that allows researchers to associate
      molecular programs with brain regions, networks, and functional states.
      Instead of treating imaging patterns as abstract signals,
      imaging transcriptomics grounds them in underlying biological mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Brain Disorders</h2>
    <p>
      Many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases show distinct spatial patterns
      in the brain. Certain regions degenerate earlier, exhibit abnormal activity,
      or display altered connectivity.
      Imaging transcriptomics helps explain these patterns by revealing
      which genes and molecular pathways are enriched in vulnerable regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, differences in gene-expression gradients across the cortex
      may help explain why specific brain networks are more susceptible to
      disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, or ALS.
      This molecular context provides insight beyond what imaging alone can offer.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Disease-related brain patterns are not random.
      They reflect underlying molecular organization encoded in gene expression.
    </div>

    <h2>From Brain Maps to Biological Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      Modern brain imaging generates detailed maps of structure, function,
      and dynamics. However, interpreting these maps remains challenging.
      Imaging transcriptomics adds a biological layer that helps translate
      imaging features into interpretable mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      By associating imaging-derived patterns with gene sets, cell types,
      and molecular pathways, researchers can move from descriptive observations
      toward mechanistic understanding. This shift is essential for building
      clinically meaningful models of brain disease.
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of AI in Imaging Transcriptomics</h2>
    <p>
      Integrating imaging and transcriptomic data is computationally demanding.
      These datasets differ in scale, resolution, and structure.
      Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in aligning,
      modeling, and interpreting these complex data sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graph-based models, representation learning, and interpretable AI
      enable the brain to be modeled as an interconnected system—
      one that links molecular signals to functional networks.
      Importantly, transparency and interpretability are key,
      especially when insights are intended for biomedical discovery.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      AI should not only predict brain states,
      but also reveal how molecular mechanisms give rise to them.
    </div>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      Imaging transcriptomics represents a shift in how we study the brain.
      It moves neuroscience toward a truly integrative view,
      where genes, cells, circuits, and behavior are studied together.
      As datasets grow and methods mature,
      this approach has the potential to transform how we understand
      brain development, aging, and disease.
    </p>

    <p>
      By grounding brain imaging in molecular biology,
      imaging transcriptomics brings us closer to a unified,
      biologically interpretable model of the brain—
      one that connects the smallest genetic signals
      to the most complex human behaviors.
